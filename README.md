# neurips2019challenge
Solution for our Neurips 2019 challenge on [traffic movie forecasting](https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/conference-programme-2019/) - top-6 teams.

# Background 
## Dataset
The high-resolution traffic map videos for the challenge were derived from positions reported by a
large fleet of probe vehicles over 12 months, and are based on over 100 billion probe points. Each
video frame summarizes GPS trajectories (of 3 channels, encode speed, volume, and direction of
traffic) mapped to spatio-temporal cells, sampled every 5 minutes and of size 495 Ë† 436.
